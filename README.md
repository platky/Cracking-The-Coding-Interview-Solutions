# Working Through Cracking The Coding Interview
While reading and working through Cracking the Coding Interview 5th Edition I outline thought processes and solutions.

To better prepare myself for interviews I will be attempting to follow some guidelines for each question(s).
1. Write the solution on paper or in a text editor with no syntax detection
2. Test the program by hand without running
3. Debug as needed
4. Actually run the program
5. Debug further
6. Verify with provided solutions if available

I will attempt to time myself while working through problems.

All code will be my own unless otherwise noted.
